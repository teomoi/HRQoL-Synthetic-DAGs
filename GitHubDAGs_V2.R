# The simulation study involved randomly generating samples (patients) based on 
# each one of the two DAGs considered each time (generally denoted as DAG1 and DAG2),
# using the "rbn" function with the R package bnlearn.
# The number 𝑘 represented the sample size in each case, namely the number of 
# simulated patients (completed questionnaires) and received the values of 
# 100, 500, 1000 and 5000.

# Example.
